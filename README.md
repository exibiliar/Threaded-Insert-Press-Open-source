## Let's Build It

### Prerequisites

Before you start assembling the press you will need the following 
- 1X m5 nut wrench
- 1X M5 allen wrench
- The components you find inside the BOM
- Scissors or something to cut the belt

### Step 1
As the first thing you need **"Base.stl"** then **"2040 V Slot Extrusion 400mm"** and as the last thing 2X **"M5 x 30 Button head"**
<br>
<br>

### Step 2
Screw **"Base.stl"** with **"2040 V Slot Extrusion 400mm"**

### Step 3
The components we need to assemble the front carriage are. 

- 7X **M5 x 30 Button head**
- 7X **M5 Nut**
- 3X **608RS Bearings**
- 3X **Bearings Out.stl**
- 3X **Bearings In.stl**
- 3X **Spacer.stl**
- 1X **Decentration Post .stl**
- 1X **Front Carriage.stl**
- 1X **Soldering Arm.stl**
- 1X **Soldering Iron Grip Standard .stl** or **Soldering Iron Grip.stl**

Please check before installing **Soldering Iron Grip** if your tin soldering iron is compatible

### Step 4
Install **Bearings In.stl** over **M5 x 30 Button head** and Press **Bearings Out.stl** over **608RS Bearings**
<br>

### Step 5
Now combine the two parts and do it twice more

### Step 6
Now put **Spacer.stl** on top of two bearings as in the image
<br>
<br>

### Step 7
Put **Decentration Post .stl** above the last bolt
<br>
<br>

 ### Step 8
Now install everything on **Front Carriage.stl** and pay attention to the orientation of the part, the bearings should be on the inside of the front carriage to be sure if the bearings are facing upwards the **FRONT** should be upside down
<br>

### Step 9
Now place two screws inside **Soldering Iron Grip.Stl**.

### Step 10
Now house two bolts inside **Soldering Arm.stl** and screw it together with **Soldering Iron Grip.stl**.
<br>
<br>
 <img src="https://github.com/exibiliar/Threaded-Insert-Press-Open-source/blob/main/IMG/IMG_20230927_172356.jpg" width=20% height=30%>

 ### Step 11
Once this is done we are ready to assemble the two parts together 
<br>
<br>
 <img src="https://github.com/exibiliar/Threaded-Insert-Press-Open-source/blob/main/IMG/IMG_20230927_172634.jpg" width=20% height=30%>

 ### Step 12
Place one end of the belt inside **Base.stl** facing inward with the grooves and place over **Soldering Arm** and screw it on like the other side
<br>

 ### Step 13
Repeat the same process also for **Rear Carriage .stl**, now we need other coponents which are

- 10X **Washers**
- 3X **M5 Nut**
- 1X **Cover.stl**
- 1X **Weight Arm.stl**

<br>
<br>
 <img src="https://github.com/exibiliar/Threaded-Insert-Press-Open-source/blob/main/IMG/IMG_20230927_173255.jpg" width=40% height=50%>

 ### Step 14
Now cut the belt to 45cm in length and install the newly cut end on **Rear Carriage .stl** with the clamping done by **Weight Arm.stl** and install an **M5 Nut** for added security 
<br>
<br>
 <img src="https://github.com/exibiliar/Threaded-Insert-Press-Open-source/blob/main/IMG/IMG_20230927_173542.jpg" width=20% height=30%>

  ### Step 15
Put washers over the screws (it may take more or less depending on your soldering iron) 
<br>
<br>

  ### Step 16
Now put **Cover.stl** above **Rear Carriage**.
<br>
<br>

  ### Step 17
Tighten everything with two nuts
<br>
<br>

  ### Step 18
This should be the result so far
<br>

### Step 19
Now we go to press over the last two **Bearings H.stl** bearings and immediately install **Pulley Plate .stl** on **2040 V Slot Extrusion 400mm** with two screws, once this is done we can install as done previously the bearings and check that the carriages slide well 
<br>

 ### Step 20
Now that you have finished installing everything rotate the **Decentration Post .stl** to keep the two carriages from jolting, if the belt should not be totally straight just loosen the nuts a bit and fix it
